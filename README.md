<h2>What Is Satış Ortaklığı?</h2>
<p>
It is a system that works with the special plugin I developed for Woocommerce. It works with the database used for the e-commerce platform. </p>
<p>What can be done with this system:</p>
<ul>
<li>To see the sales volumes of the sales partners</li>
<li>View the status of orders in sales made by affiliates</li>
<li>To see the progress of sales partners,</li>
<li>Changing the vesting rates,</li>
<li>Detection of wrong orders,</li>
<li>List of sales partners,</li>
<li>Lots of stats</li>
</ul>


<h2>Server Requirements</h2>
<p>PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.
</p>

<p>
It should work on 5.4.8 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://codeigniter.com/userguide3/installation/index.html">installation section</a> of the CodeIgniter User Guide.</p>
